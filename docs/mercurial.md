# Mercurial and Bitbucket


I like working with Mercurial. It is relatively straight forward and safe to use, with simple easy-to-remember commands, yet so powerful and flexibel that many large organization have chosen to use it over Git and other tools, Facebook being the best known example.

The options for hosting a Mercurial repo are limited, but fortunately  Bitbucket, is a very good solution.

## Install Mercurial

You will need to download and install Mercurial.  You can get it at [www.mercurial-scm.org](https://www.mercurial-scm.org)

You may also want to look at [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=clone_repo_mac) or [TortoiseHg](https://tortoisehg.bitbucket.io/)

I will leave it to you to figure out the detail on installing and verifying.


## Clone or fork?

Depending on what you want to do, you may wish to either clone the george-application repo or fork-and-clone.

If you simply want to download the repo and keep it up to date, then cloning the main repo is the way to go.

If you think you might want to to contribute, then you will want to first make a "fork", i.e. a linked copy under your own name on Bitbucket, and then clone your own repo to your machine.  That way, you can "push" changes to your own copy on Bitbucket, and then optionally make a "pull-request" to the main repo.

If you don't know yet, then start with a simple clone. It is easy to make a fork and change your settings in your clone later.


### Clone

See ["Clone a Mercurial repository"](https://confluence.atlassian.com/get-started-with-bitbucket/clone-a-repository-861178563.html) to get started.
